%% It is required to construct an equilateral triangle on the straight line AB. We start by creating the line

%% Our first line becomes the radius of our circles needed to draw an equalitarial triangle. We draw two cirles with the center at
%% end points of the first line

%% From our endpoints, we draw a line extending to the top intersection of the circle:
